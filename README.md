# JavaScript Unit Testing Framework

Example project to allow me to show how best to unit test a JavaScript Express application.

## Install

Clone this repository and install the dependencies as follows:

```
git clone git@github.com:MarcL/js-unit-testing-framework.git
npm install
```

## Running the tests

The code sets up a basic Express server with a few routes and some tests which cover testing the server setup. The middlewares have no tests as they're simply there for stubbing expectations in the `launch.test.js` tests. Run the test suite using npm:

```
npm test
```
